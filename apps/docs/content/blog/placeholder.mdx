# Introducing Thalo

We're excited to share Thalo with the world.

**Thalo** (Thought And Lore Language) is a structured plain-text format for capturing personal
knowledge, thoughts, and references. It's designed for the age of AI—where plain text is the
universal interface.

## Why We Built This

Most note-taking tools fall into two camps:

1. **Too loose**: Markdown is great for documents, but terrible for structured knowledge. No schema,
   no validation, no types.
2. **Too rigid**: Apps lock you into proprietary formats, subscription models, and features you
   don't need.

We wanted something in between. Something with enough structure to be queryable, but simple enough
to write by hand. Something that AI could understand natively.

## What Thalo Gives You

- **Entities**: Define what kinds of knowledge you track (opinions, journals, references, lore)
- **Validation**: Schema-checked entries that catch mistakes early
- **Links**: Cross-reference entries with `^link` syntax
- **Tags**: Organize with `#hashtags`
- **Syntheses**: Query your knowledge base and prompt AI to synthesize

## The Ecosystem

Thalo ships with real tooling from day one:

- **CLI**: Initialize, validate, actualize syntheses
- **LSP**: Autocomplete, diagnostics, go-to-definition
- **VSCode Extension**: Syntax highlighting + LSP integration
- **Prettier Plugin**: Auto-format your `.thalo` files
- **Tree-sitter Grammar**: Full parser for building more tools

## Get Started

```bash
pnpm add -g @rejot-dev/thalo-cli
thalo init
thalo check
```
