## What is Thalo?

Thalo (Personal Thought And Lore Language) is a structured plain-text format for your knowledge.
It's:

- **Plain text** - Version control with git, search with grep, edit with any tool
- **Structured** - Not just markdown soup, actual typed entries with metadata
- **Queryable** - Cross-reference with `^links`, filter by `#tags`, define syntheses
- **AI-ready** - Feed your knowledge base to LLMs with full context

## Core Concepts

### Entities

Define custom types for your knowledge (opinions, journals, references, lore, or anything you need).

### Entries

Create structured entries with metadata, links, tags, and content sections.

### Syntheses

Query your knowledge base and generate AI prompts for synthesis.

### Links & Tags

Build a web of connected knowledge with `^links` and organize with `#tags`.

## Example

```thalo
2026-01-08T14:30Z create opinion "Plain text is the universal interface" ^plain-text-ftw #pkm
  confidence: "high"

  # Claim
  When your knowledge lives in plain text, everything can read it and write it.

  # Reasoning
  - grep works. git works. your editor works.
  - AI writes plain text natively—no plugins, no export, no friction.
  - structured text gives AI the context it needs to help you think.
```
