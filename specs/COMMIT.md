## Rules

The goal is a gitr history that tells a clear story and allows easy debugging, revering, and
cherry-picking.

### General

- ALWAYS keep tests, types, and docs together with the actual code that is being changed.
- Each line of the commit message should be less than 72 characters.

### Commit Structure

- Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `perf`, `style`, `ci`, `build`
- Scopes are package based, commits can have multiple scopes.

### Packages Based Scopes:

[SCOPE] - [FOLDER]

- thalo - packages/thalo
- cli - apps/thalo-cli
- lsp - packages/thalo-lsp
- prettier - packages/thalo-prettier
- vscode - packages/thalo-vscode
- grammar - packages/grammar
- action - packages/thalo-action
- scripts - packages/scripts
- docs - apps/docs

### Changesets

- The changeset file HAS TO BE part of the commit that includes the changes
- Create a changeset ONLY if the changes affect end users of Fragno (library authors or app
  developers using Fragno)
- DO create changesets for:
  - New features, APIs, or functionality
  - Bug fixes that affect user code
  - Breaking changes
- DO NOT create changesets for:
  - Internal refactoring that doesn't change public APIs
  - Test-only changes
  - Build tooling or CI updates
  - Development workflow improvements
  - Example app changes (unless they demonstrate new features)
- Changesets should be a single line.
- In changesets, wrap line breaks at 100 characters.
- Also add feat/fix/etc prefix to changeset description.
- ALWAYS use patch release unless explicitly asked for a major or minor release.
